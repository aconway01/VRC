The information in our Web logs is not personally viewable and no attempt is made to link it with the individuals that browse our Web site.
                        If, during your visit to VRC, you send us an e-mail message, we will collect the e-mail address and contents of the message, including audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

                        We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to subscribe to our services or participate in surveys. Collecting personal information is necessary in order for VRC to deliver the services requested. We only collect, retain, and use personal information where we believe it is essential to administer our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities requested by our customers.
